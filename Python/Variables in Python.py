#Exercise: Python Variables
#Create a variable called break and assign it a value 5. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see.

#break = 5

#Create two variables. One to store your birth year and another one to store current year. Now calculate your age using these two variables

birth_year = 1993
current_year = 2023
age = current_year - birth_year
print("My age is", age)

#Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and then print your full name using these variables

first_name = "Odari"
middle_name = "Gerald"
last_name = "Angule"

full_name = first_name + " " + middle_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)

#Answer which of these are invalid variable names: _nation 1record record1 record_one record-one record^one continue
# Invalid variable names are: 1record record^one continue
